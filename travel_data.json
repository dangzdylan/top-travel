After all, the weather is just about as pleasant as it gets, and two of the countrys biggest festivals take place during the unofficial best month of the year. Tiji Festival is a celebration of the (presumed) triumph of good over evil, while Buddha Jayanti is a colourful love letter to the life and times of Gautam Buddha. If you need more than two massive festivals, remember that the temples of Bhaktapur are arguably at their most accessible during May."

Its hard to miss the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower (or the Duomo) at the city centre, and climbing its 463 steps is totally worth it for the vista at the top across Florences terracotta rooftops."

September, however, is a blissful time to visit as the crowds thin out and the history and culture of this fascinating little country take centre stage. Perast (just down the road from Kotor) is the pick of the coast, while culture vultures should make a beeline for Cetinje (the royal capital) and the indomitable Mount Loven, the final resting place of 19th-century prince-poet Njego."
